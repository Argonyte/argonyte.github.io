## Introduction

&emsp;&emsp;Hello World. Sort of cliche to start with something like this. But every start point begins with a hello, every program begins with a hello world and this journey will also begin the same way. I've hosted a static page on github pages since the end of 2020 and never really bothered changing it till now. This new page will now be hosting my blogs and any projects I do from now on.

### Overview
I am no guru at coding webpages. My first website that I hosted back in 2020 looked something out of a circus. Sketchy CSS and weird HTML here and there and it was held with hopes and programming passion. Then I forgot about it, moving on to making blogs on OSINT and other projects on Medium and Github.

Stuff does come full circle however. Going back to my old website, I realised how disorganized my content is, a blog on medium, projects on github, website(?). ~~So I will be slowly migrating all of my medium blogs over to my new static blog site.~~ Hopefully over time this would flourish into something I have aimed for, a central place for my projects and share what I have learned with people. I will focus on OSINT and Red Team. However, I will also share some Finance related research and Anti Money Laundering investigations points.

I am not going to bother porting Medium blogs. If you wish to read them which would be a good day or two worth of content, you can through this link: https://medium.com/@argonyte.cybersec

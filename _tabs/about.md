&emsp;&emsp;Hello there! I am Argonyte or Vesper. A Cybersecurity Researcher with background in OSINT and Penetration Testing. I picked up cybersecurity in 2020 during the pandemic and have been more geared towards offensive side of cybersecurity, mostly because that's how I began my journey before I "officially" started learning. 

I was when I was 10 and was gifted a Lenovo netbook with a 256kbps internet dongle that I could only use for 2 hours at a time before I had to pay to get service. Geared with a laptop and internet, I had absolutely no idea what to do besides play games. Which I did... By taking over a website admin panels and Age of Empires 2 (JE) to upload into my Nokia Symbian Handheld. 

You can also find me on [LinkedIn][MyLinkedIn]{:target="_blank"}.
